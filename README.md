# fake-npo-data

Use Python to generate a fake nonprofit fundraising data for analysis or demonstration!

What's this?

I needed a dataset to practice creating dashboards and couldn't find a good one. I needed dummy data, but I wanted it to be realistic with:

- donors that "feel" real with different levels of commitment, repeat-giving, and favorite types of giving
- donations spread out over the life of an event or campaign
- householding with a variety of nametypes: Mr. & Mrs Jones / Sandy Jones & Kenyon Smith / Sandy & Kenyon Smith as well as 7.5% same-sex couples
- organizations like foundations, government, corporations


## Additional Features

- Custom date range
- Can choose amount of constituents and donations
- Rich transaction data includng customizable funds, campaigns and appeals
- Adjust campaign response rates and repeat giving percentages

I made heavy use of Claude in generating this.
